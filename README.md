# KrossSwap: Autonomous AI-Powered Cross-Chain Swaps

## Introduction

KrossSwap is a non-custodial AI-powered cross-chain swap assistant that leverages the Chainflip SDK and LLM technology. Through natural conversations, users can generate payment channels and execute swaps by simply scanning QR codes in the Telegram web app. The system is fully transparent - users can verify all transactions on the Chainflip Explorer with guidance from the AI agent. What sets KrossSwap apart is its self-sustaining model: the bot autonomously manages operational costs by using Lit Protocol to direct brokerage commissions towards node server expenses and LLM API costs via smart contracts. This project demonstrates how AI can make DeFi more accessible while maintaining true decentralization and self-sovereignty.

## Vision

KrossSwap reimagines cross-chain swaps by combining conversational AI with non-custodial infrastructure. Our vision is to make DeFi accessible through natural dialogue while ensuring users maintain complete control of their funds. The system sustains itself through automated commission-based payments, creating a truly autonomous and user-friendly cross-chain bridge.

## How It Works

1. **Conversational Interface**: Users interact with KrossSwap through natural language on Telegram.
2. **AI-Driven Understanding**: Advanced language models interpret user requests and guide the conversation.
3. **Chainflip Integration**: Real-time quotes and secure, non-custodial swaps are facilitated using the Chainflip SDK. For more details on Chainflip's brokerage system, refer to the [Chainflip Documentation on Deposit Channels & Brokers](https://docs.chainflip.io/concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers).

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/krossswap.git
cd krossswap
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If not, install it using:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Gaianet Server

To run the Gaianet server, use the following commands to configure it. For detailed instructions on deploying a GaiaNet node, refer to the following resources:

- [GaiaNet Documentation](https://docs.gaianet.ai/)
- [GaiaNet Litepaper](https://docs.gaianet.ai/litepaper/)

```bash
gaianet config \
  --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/london/resolve/main/london_768_nomic-embed-text-v1.5-f16.snapshot.tar.gz \
  --embedding-url https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/resolve/main/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --embedding-ctx-size 8192 \

  --rag-prompt "The following text is the context for the user question.\n----------------\n"
```

### Step 4: Configure the Gaianet Server

Create a configuration file for the Gaianet server with the following content:

```json
{
  "address": "",

```

### Step 7: Start the Project

Finally, start the KrossSwap project:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This setup will ensure that your Gaianet server is configured to work seamlessly with the KrossSwap project, providing the necessary AI capabilities for cross-chain swaps.

## Self-Sustaining Operations

KrossSwap implements the Lit Protocol to autonomously manage payments for its LLM node server and Node.js server costs. This is achieved through smart contracts that handle subscription payments, ensuring that the platform remains operational without manual intervention. The integration of Lit Protocol allows KrossSwap to:

- **Generate Payment Channels**: Users can interact with the AI agent to create payment channels. This is done through conversational exchanges, where the AI guides the user in setting up a payment channel.

- **Non-Custodial Payments**: The platform is non-custodial, meaning users retain control over their funds throughout the process. Payments are made directly to a QR code generated by the Telegram web app, ensuring a secure and transparent transaction.

- **Verification via Chainflip Explorer**: Users can verify the authenticity of the process using the Chainflip Explorer. The AI agent provides links and instructions to check transaction details, ensuring transparency and trust.


## Revenue Model & Brokerage System

KrossSwap operates as a Chainflip broker, leveraging the protocol's built-in brokerage system to generate sustainable revenue. Here's how it works:

### Brokerage Fee Structure
- As a Chainflip broker, KrossSwap can set fees between 0-1000 basis points on all swaps
- These fees are automatically deducted from the USDC amount of successful swaps
- Fees are credited directly to KrossSwap's broker account on the State Chain

### Automated Fee Distribution
KrossSwap uses Lit Protocol to automatically distribute collected fees:
- 40% - Server operational costs (node hosting, API calls)
- 30% - LLM API usage fees
- 20% - Development fund
- 10% - Protocol treasury

### User Benefits
- Transparent fee structure visible before each swap
- No hidden costs or additional charges
- All fees can be verified on Chainflip Explorer
- Lower fees compared to traditional cross-chain bridges

### Technical Implementation
- KrossSwap submits Deposit Channel Requests to the State Chain on behalf of users
- Each request includes the user's swap details and destination address
- Users can verify transaction hashes before making deposits
- The system automatically processes fees through smart contracts

This revenue model ensures KrossSwap remains self-sustaining while providing competitive rates for users. All fee distributions are handled autonomously through Lit Protocol's smart contract system, requiring no manual intervention.
